# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose of the project:

Creating interactive map is great tool for data visulation. Maps helps us to understand, explore and make decisions about our world. Jeojason format is the industry standard for representing simple geographical futures like;

        Points which contains locations like addresses lat and long coordinates
        Linestrings which contains coordinates for travel routes, higyways, tectonic plates
        Polygons which contains combined coordinates for bountries of countries, states, zip codes.
        
  and non-spatial attributes which the data that is independent of geographic considerations like ;
  
        elevation, 
        temperatures, 
        huuricanes,
        magnatuide of earthquates.

 Jeojason have been used by many apps for ride sharing, navigation, delivery of goods are some examples. 
 
        
 ## About the project:
 
 In this challange we will create sigtfull data visulation with interactive futures on earthquakes from around the world. 

Making earthquakes map informative and easy to use will generate positive buzz for disater reporting newtwork.We wanted to show each earthquate on a map with popup marker, the diameter of the marker reflects the magnatuide of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higer magnatuide appares with larger and darker colored markers.


## Methods:

We pulled the data from US geolacigal survey website, retrive the data using javascipt, d3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a mapbox map to an API request.


Finally we added the faultlines to the map to reflect the relation between sysmic activity of techtonic plates and earthquakes.
